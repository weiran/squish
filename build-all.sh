# Build script for Squish - creates self-contained executables for specified platforms
# This script builds the Squish console application with embedded .NET runtime
# so users don't need to install .NET separately.
#
# Usage:
#   ./build-all.sh                    # Build for all platforms
#   ./build-all.sh win                # Build for Windows only
#   ./build-all.sh macos              # Build for macOS (both x64 and ARM64)
#   ./build-all.sh linux              # Build for Linux only
#   ./build-all.sh win macos          # Build for Windows and macOS
#   ./build-all.sh win-x64            # Build for Windows x64 specifically
#   ./build-all.sh osx-x64            # Build for macOS x64 specifically
#   ./build-all.sh osx-arm64          # Build for macOS ARM64 specifically
#   ./build-all.sh linux-x64          # Build for Linux x64 specifically
